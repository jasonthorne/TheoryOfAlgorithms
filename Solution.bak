;testList

;make permuation lists from list of all numbers and opperators:

;(define permList (permutations (testList))) ;- doesnt like testList being predefined! 

;(define permList (permutations (define testList2 (list + / * 1 2 3))))  - Doesnt like list being defined here!
;(define testList2 (list 1 2 3))

;(define permList (permutations (list 1 2 3)))

;permList

;grab each element from the list of lists, defined as their own lists.

;list holding numbers and opperators:

originalList

;create stack, holding first element of origianl list:
(define stack (list (car originalList)))

stack

;create remaining list holding second to last elements of oiginal list:
(define remainingList (cdr originalList))


remainingList

(car remainingList)

;add once more to stack list, now using car of remaining list:
(cons stack (car remainingList)) ;WRONG!! ahows as having added car to list here, but in print of stack its not there! 

stack
;remainingList
;take firsr element offirstList and put in the stack:
;(cons stack (car originalList))


;define (originalListMinusCar (cdr originalList))
